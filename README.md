Cryptocurrency Tracker

This is a cryptocurrency tracker that fetches data from the CoinGecko API and diplays it on the screen for the user to see. They are able to search from 
hundreds of cryptocurrencies and keep track of their favorites. 

It is still actively being developed and expanded.
Major features that I am currently working on...
1. Adding an authentication system (user accounts)
2. Include stock charts to the tracker using a stock market API as well
3. Favoriting or adding to a list tracker (like a stock market app)
